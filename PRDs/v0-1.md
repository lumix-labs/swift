# Swift - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Swift is a legacy code management and modernization platform designed to help engineering leaders transform legacy systems into competitive advantages without risky rewrites. It allows teams to accelerate development cycles, reduce technical debt, and implement modernization incrementally.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Engineering leaders managing legacy systems
- Development teams working on legacy codebases
- Technical architects planning modernization efforts
- DevOps teams supporting legacy deployments

### 1.3 Problem Statement
Organizations with legacy systems face several challenges:

**Description:** Deep structural analysis of code repositories to provide insights into language distribution, file types, and overall composition.

**Requirements:**
- Analyze language distribution with line count and percentage breakdowns
- Index repository structure and file types
- Identify file count and size metrics
- Generate summary statistics for technical leadership

### 2.2 Technical Debt Identification
**Description:** Identify areas of technical debt and code quality issues across repositories.

**Requirements:**
- Analyze code complexity metrics
- Detect long functions and methods
- Identify code duplication
- Analyze comment ratios and detect excessive comments
- Generate an overall code quality score

### 2.3 Security Vulnerability Detection
**Description:** Comprehensive security scanning of codebases.

**Requirements:**
- Scan code for OWASP Top 10 and CWE vulnerabilities
- Scan dependencies for known CVEs
- Detect hardcoded credentials and secrets
- Analyze security anti-patterns
- Generate risk scores and remediation recommendations

### 2.5 Impact Analysis
**Description:** Determine the potential impact of changes to specific files or components.

**Requirements:**
- Identify high-impact files (changes affect many other files)
- Identify low-impact files (safe to change)
- Detect isolated files with no dependencies
- Generate impact scores for each file

### 2.6 Analytics Collection
**Description:** Store and retrieve analytics data from analyses for trend monitoring.

**Requirements:**
- Store timestamped analytics snapshots
- Retrieve historical analytics data
